This is the repository for fixed_point_linear_based_power_flow_for_unbalanced_three_phase_distribution_network


The implementation of the code is refer to [1].

The verification is conducted with OPENDSS.

If not install OPENDSS, you should install it.

The opendss_ieee34.py : the result of the opendss _ ieee34

Linear_Model/FPL_powerflow.py : here is the main file for FPL based power flow for unbalanced three phase distribution network.
